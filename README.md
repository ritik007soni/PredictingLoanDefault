# PredictingLoanDefault
  * This project aims to predict the loan defaulters using a random forest algorithm, which is a machine learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their results.
  * The project uses various features of the borrowers, such as income, age, marital status, etc., to train and test the random forest model and evaluate its performance.
  * To deal with the class imbalance problem, where the number of defaulters is much lower than the number of non-defaulters, the project also uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
